# Alpha Gamma Counter processing

This program can process 3D data arrays time.dat generated by <https://github.com/mvxe/agc>.
It requires gnuplot.
Before processing the arrays, you need to plot timesum.dat:
```
plot "timesum.dat" binary format='%uint32' using ($0/125000000):1 with lines notitle
```
and make sure that the first 1/4 and last 1/4 contain only background, while the center contains the signal (see [example](sample/area1-time.png)).
You can configure the delays for agc by editing agc_conf: "Observed interval after trigger event" variable to achieve that.

===================

Compile with:
```
cmake .
make
```
For help run:
```
./agc
```
The program is interactive, so just follow instructions.
An [example](sample/sample.png) of what the program produces. 

The generated area files may be plotted with gnuplot:
```
plot "time_area1.dat" binary format='%uint32' using ($0/125000000):1 with lines notitle
```
An [example](sample/area1-time.png). From this the state lifetime can be determined of the peak markes as Area1.
