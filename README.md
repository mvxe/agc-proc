# Alpha Gamma Counter processing

This program can process 3D data arrays generated by <https://github.com/mvxe/agc>.
It requires gnuplot.


Compile with:
```
cmake .
make
```
For help run:
```
./agc

The program is interactive, so just follow instructions.
An [example](sample/sample.png) of what the program produces. 

The generated area files may be plotted with gnuplot:
```
plot "time_area1.dat" binary format='%uint32' using ($0/125000000):1 with lines notitle
```
An [example](sample/area1-time.png). From this the state lifetime can be determined of the peak markes as Area1.
