An [example](sample/sample.png) of what the program produces. 

The area files may be plotted with gnuplot:
```
plot "time_area1.dat" binary format='%uint32' using ($0/125000000):1 with lines notitle
```
An [example](area1-time/sample.png). From this the state lifetime can be determined of the peak markes as Area1.
